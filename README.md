Analysis of Chicago Marathon results, looking for effect of BQ time qualifications

Marathons are a very goal-oriented sport, as can be seen by a histogram of race results, where there are clear spikes in the number of runners immediately prior to even, half hour increments.

A Boston Marathon qualifying time is a goal for a subset of runners as well, but this time has shifted a few times in the last two decades due to increasing demand.

My end goal is to see how much effect these shifts have on marathon times, and whether the ability to attain these times disproportionately affects men, women, older, or younger runners (due to different time standards for each).
